var gradingInsturctionsPrompt = "Below is your grading rubric: \n\n- Correctness: If the answer correctly answer the question, below are the details for different scores:\n  - Score 1: the answer is completely incorrect, doesn\u2019t mention anything about the question or is completely contrary to the correct answer.\n      - For example, when asked \u201CHow to terminate a databricks cluster\u201D, the answer is empty string, or content that\u2019s completely irrelevant, or sorry I don\u2019t know the answer.\n  - Score 2: the answer provides some relevance to the question and answer one aspect of the question correctly.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to terminate a databricks cluster\n          - Answer: Databricks cluster is a cloud-based computing environment that allows users to process big data and run distributed data processing tasks efficiently.\n          - Or answer:  In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the \"Clusters\" tab. And then this is a hard question that I need to think more about it\n  - Score 3: the answer mostly answer the question but is missing or hallucinating on one critical aspect.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to terminate a databricks cluster\u201D\n          - Answer: \u201CIn the Databricks workspace, navigate to the \"Clusters\" tab.\n          Find the cluster you want to terminate from the list of active clusters.\n          And then you\u2019ll find a button to terminate all clusters at once\u201D\n  - Score 4: the answer correctly answer the question and not missing any major aspect\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to terminate a databricks cluster\n          - Answer: In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the \"Clusters\" tab.\n          Find the cluster you want to terminate from the list of active clusters.\n          Click on the down-arrow next to the cluster name to open the cluster details.\n          Click on the \"Terminate\" button. A confirmation dialog will appear. Click \"Terminate\" again to confirm the action.\u201D\n- Comprehensiveness: How comprehensive is the answer, does it fully answer all aspects of the question and provide comprehensive explanation and other necessary information. Below are the details for different scores:\n  - Score 1: typically if the answer is completely incorrect, then the comprehensiveness is also zero score.\n  - Score 2: if the answer is correct but too short to fully answer the question, then we can give score 1 for comprehensiveness.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to use databricks API to create a cluster?\n          - Answer: First, you will need a Databricks access token with the appropriate permissions. You can generate this token through the Databricks UI under the 'User Settings' option. And then (the rest is missing)\n  - Score 3: the answer is correct and roughly answer the main aspects of the question, but it\u2019s missing description about details. Or is completely missing details about one minor aspect.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to use databricks API to create a cluster?\n          - Answer: You will need a Databricks access token with the appropriate permissions. Then you\u2019ll need to set up the request URL, then you can make the HTTP Request. Then you can handle the request response.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to use databricks API to create a cluster?\n          - Answer: You will need a Databricks access token with the appropriate permissions. Then you\u2019ll need to set up the request URL, then you can make the HTTP Request. Then you can handle the request response.\n  - Score 4: the answer is correct, and covers all the main aspects of the question\n- Readability: How readable is the answer, does it have redundant information or incomplete information that hurts the readability of the answer.\n  - Score 1: the answer is completely unreadable, e.g. fully of symbols that\u2019s hard to read; e.g. keeps repeating the words that it\u2019s very hard to understand the meaning of the paragraph. No meaningful information can be extracted from the answer.\n  - Score 2: the answer is slightly readable, there are irrelevant symbols or repeated words, but it can roughly form a meaningful sentence that cover some aspects of the answer.\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to use databricks API to create a cluster?\n          - Answer: You you  you  you  you  you  will need a Databricks access token with the appropriate permissions. And then then you\u2019ll need to set up the request URL, then you can make the HTTP Request. Then Then Then Then Then Then Then Then Then\n  - Score 3: the answer is correct and mostly readable, but there is one obvious piece that\u2019s affecting the readability (mentioning of irrelevant pieces, repeated words)\n      - Example:\n          - Question: How to terminate a databricks cluster\n          - Answer: In the Databricks workspace, navigate to the \"Clusters\" tab.\n          Find the cluster you want to terminate from the list of active clusters.\n          Click on the down-arrow next to the cluster name to open the cluster details.\n          Click on the \"Terminate\" button\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n          A confirmation dialog will appear. Click \"Terminate\" again to confirm the action.\n  - Score 4: the answer is correct and reader friendly, no obvious piece that affect readability.";
